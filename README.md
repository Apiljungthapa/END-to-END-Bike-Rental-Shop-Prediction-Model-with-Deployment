# END to END Bike Rental Shop Prediction Model with Deployment

This project implements an end-to-end machine learning model for predicting bike rentals in a bike rental shop. The model utilizes historical data on factors such as temperature, day, season, etc., to forecast the demand for bikes in the future. Additionally, the model is deployed using a web application to provide real-time predictions.

## Overview

The END to END Bike Rental Shop Prediction Model is designed to help bike rental shops anticipate the demand for bikes based on various factors. By analyzing historical rental data and weather conditions, the model aims to accurately predict the number of bikes that will be rented out in the future, allowing the shop to optimize inventory management and meet customer demand effectively.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Gather historical data on bike rentals, weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.), day of the week, season, holidays, etc.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, scale numerical features, and perform feature engineering.
- **Model Training**: Train machine learning models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks on the preprocessed data to predict bike rentals.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), etc.
- **Deployment**: Deploy the trained model into production using a web application framework like Flask or Django to provide real-time predictions for bike rentals.

## Usage

1. **Data Collection**: Collect historical data on bike rentals, weather conditions, and other relevant features from sources such as APIs, databases, or CSV files.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data, handle missing values, encode categorical variables, scale numerical features, and perform feature engineering to prepare the dataset for model training.

3. **Model Training**: Train machine learning models on the preprocessed dataset using libraries such as scikit-learn or TensorFlow. Experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters to optimize model performance.

4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained models using cross-validation or a separate test set. Calculate evaluation metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, etc., to assess model performance and make improvements as necessary.

5. **Deployment**: Deploy the trained model into production using a web application framework like Flask or Django. Integrate the model with a user-friendly interface to accept input data (e.g., weather conditions) and provide real-time predictions for bike rentals.
